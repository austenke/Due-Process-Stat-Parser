### What is this?
This tool parses log files from the game Due Process (https://store.steampowered.com/app/753650/Due_Process/) and generates comprehensive stats for the player in this game.

### How do I use it?
Import the NPM package and provide a File object to `LogParser.parseFile`. If you're actually using this package, I trust you to figure it out from there :)
